# Snapp
Hi everyone, this is our first professional group project and it was completed in 1 week and I am happy to share my experience with you here.



# Introducing
**team members:**
- Milad Vaghef nezhad (leader)
- Hamed Mehr
- Fatemeh Mousavi

# Details site

We used **HTML** and **CSS** languages ​​to build the site.

At first, we sketched the site and tasked it using the Trello application, and each person did their desired part, and at the end of the project, we made the site responsive so that the site can be used on mobile phones.
